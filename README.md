## Important

Install a backup tool like snapper or timeshift, and backup your system before installing Hyprland using this script. This script does NOT include uninstallation of packages.

## Note

The main reason why I have not included an uninstallation script is simple. Some packages may be already installed on your system by default. If I create an uninstall script with packages that I have set to install, you may end up with an unrecoverable system.

## To Run

Clone this repo (latest commit only) to reduce file size download by using git. Change directory, make executable, and run the script.

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland.git
cd Arch-Hyprland
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
